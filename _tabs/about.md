I'm David Judge., a highly experienced Consultant and home-lab tinkerer.

I have a varied background in IT - from support, to teaching, consulting, IT management and recently working for software vendors as a "Sales or Solutions Engineer". To find out more about the professional me, please head on to my [LinkedIn Profile](https://linkedIn.com/in/davidjudge).

I started this site/blog out of a frustration that, while many sites tell the homelabber (and a few professionals too) how to do something, many of them don't explain the rationale or reason behind the steps.

This repository of projects aims to buck that trend to explain what is being done and why.

As I hone my skills, I may revisit older articles and update them.

I use my home lab to learn new skills and to provide the services I need in my home IT.  Some of the thinks I have in the home lab are:
- Proxmox server to run VMs
- Docker "server" to run containers - in fact I gave 2 of these
- n8n automation server
- DNS
- Kubernetes cluster (k3s)
- Portainer
- Traefik
- Monitoring (influxDB, Prometheus and Grafana)

I can't help but plug my services... I am an SME in Automation/orchestration and AIOps/Observability - If you want to know more, please feel free to reach out to me either by email or over LinkedIn (both links are bottom-left).
